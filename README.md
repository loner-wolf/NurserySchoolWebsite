# NurserySchoolWebsite
This is my first front-end project. I completed this project in 24hrs for an Intellectium(College Technical Fest) for event Design-A-thon. And I secured 1st postion.
This is a nursery school website for conducting online classes and it is colourful and captivating to the eyes. 

##### THIS WAS MY PROBLEM STATEMENT #####

As everything is shifted to online mode because of
the ongoing pandemic, Cambridge little ones, a
nursery school has a requirement to develop a
website for their kids where they can conduct their
school activities with ease.
The school mentioned the following requirements to
be considered -

a.) Use animations and create an experience for
young users that makes them feel as if
they’re really in the website’s world.

b.) A functionality where teachers can post
homework and where kids can upload their
homework in a fun way.

c.) Make it colorful and captivating to the eyes,
as Kids love bold, vivacious colors, so be
sure to work some into the background,
within the text and smattering among the
games, music and animation throughout the
website.

d.) Construct the navigation intuitively, Kids
don’t always choose a logical path when
navigating a website, so big, bold buttons
with clear, explanatory language is a must.

e.) All the information about the institution
should be available with a call to action along
with the image gallery lof activities
conducted.
